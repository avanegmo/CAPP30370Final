        	<p>Underwater Hockey has been around for nearly 50 years.  It was created by Alan Blake as a way to keep a British sea-diving club together during the frigid winter months. Blake founded the Southsea Sub-Aqua Club and he and other divers including John Ventham, Jack Willis, and Frank Lilleker originally played this game in Eastney Swimming Pool in Portsmouth, England. The original rules called for teams of eight players (hence "octo-"), a bat reminiscent of a tiny stick called a "pusher" (hence the "-push"), an uncoated lead puck called a "squid", and a goal known at first as a "cuttle" but soon thereafter a "gully".</p>
	    	<p>Underwater Hockey is now a fiercely competitive sport in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the Netherlands and Canada.  The first game to be played here in North America was in Canada in 1962 at a Vancouver diving club. Ten years later, the Underwater Hockey Association of British Columbia (UHABC) was formed and received support from the BC government.</p>
	    	<p>Despite its international popularity, the sport has yet to make a name for itself in the United States.  It is speculated that this is the case because underwater hockey isn't a spectator sport since the game is played underwater.</p>
	    	<p>There are 50 club teams nationwide.  Teams are both single gender and co-ed.  And the largest growing region for Underwater Hockey in the United States is California.</p>
	    	<p>In August of 2013, the 18th World Championship were held in Eger, Hungary where more than 15 countries were represented with teams of all categories including u19, u23, elite and master.</p>
